Docker
Step 1: Download the install script

curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
Step 2: Execute permission for the script

sudo chmod +x get-docker.sh
Step 3: Execute the script

./get-docker.sh
Step 4: Remove the script

rm get-docker.sh
Step 5: To manage Docker as a non-root user

sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
docker compose --version
docker --version

To run the docker file first we need to build the image, we can do it using

docker build -t [image_name]:[tag] [context_path]

docker build -t image1:1.0 .
We use dot as the context path, because our docker file is in the current directory, means the folder path of Docker file. If your docker file has another name then

docker build -t [image_name]:[tag] -f [dockerfile] [context_path]
To run the the image

docker run --name [container_name] [image_name]

docker run image1:1.0
